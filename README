## About


I created this to help test out my rails application WhySpam.Me allows you to generate a  [free disposable email](http://whyspam.me/) that you can give to websites. If they start to send you spam, you can destroy the disposable email and submit a survey letting the world know who sells your information.  If you want to fight back against spam, or just want to check out my site i would appreciate the visit. WhySpam is a creative commons licensed open source project, help out at:  http://github.com/thinkbohemian/WhySpam/tree/master

## Issues

1. Will not download attachments (i think, haven't tested this)
2. Need feedback for additional use cases, I only ever need the last email sent, but maybe a lookup based on to_email, etc. Let me know how you would envision this plugin working.
