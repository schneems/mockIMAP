## mockIMAP

mockIMAP is a plugin that compliments MockSMTP.app http://mocksmtpapp.com/. MockSMTP allows you to send and view emails in a test environment without a connection to the internet. If you are utilizing mockSMTP then the mockIMAP is a plugin that will allow you to test your receive method by downloading the last message sent to the test SMTP server. 

## install

script/plugin install git://github.com/thinkbohemian/mockIMAP.git

requires sqlite3

sudo gem install sqlite3-ruby


## Parameters

:location => (location to the default.data file in mockSMTP) 

Note, :location is optional and will default to /Users/yourusername/Documents/MockSMTP/default.data. You can find this path by opening preferences in MockSMTP.


## Examples

# get array of all emails
>> emails = getMockEmails

# get last email sent
>> lastEmail = getMockEmails.last
=> email(last)

# specify location of the mockSMTP data file - (only needed if you move the data file)
>> emails = getMockEmails(:location => '/Users/richardschneeman/Documents/MockSMTP/default.data'
=>  [email(0)...email(last)]


## About

I created this to help test out my rails application WhySpam.Me allows you to generate a  [free disposable email](http://whyspam.me/) that you can give to websites. If they start to send you spam, you can destroy the disposable email and submit a survey letting the world know who sells your information.  If you want to fight back against spam, or just want to check out my site i would appreciate the visit. WhySpam is a creative commons licensed open source project, help out at:  http://github.com/thinkbohemian/WhySpam/tree/master

## Issues

1. Will not download attachments (i think, haven't tested this)
2. Need feedback for additional use cases, I only ever need the last email sent, but maybe a lookup based on to_email, etc. Let me know how you would envision this plugin working.
