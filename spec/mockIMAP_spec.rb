## Due to the dynamic nature of this plugin, (you must send an email to receive an email) i can't think of a test 
# i can include in here without having to instantiate a new email object. If you have any good ideas on how to do this let me know
# as of now i have tested these two methods by hand.

#
#require File.dirname(__FILE__) + '/spec_helper'  
#  
#describe "mockIMAP" do  
#  
#  it "should download the latest email" do
#    puts "mockSMTP needs to be running for this to execute correctly"
#    
#      mail = getMockEmail
#      TMail::Mail.parse(mail).to.to_s.should == 
#      TMail::Mail.parse(mail).from.to_s.should == 
#      TMail::Mail.parse(mail).subject.to_s.should == 
#      TMail::Mail.parse(mail).body.to_s.should == 
#    
#  end
#end
